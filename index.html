                        <p>Hello! I'm a passionate software developer with a strong focus on building reliable, scalable, and efficient full stack applications. From backend systems to frontend interfaces, I love creating complete solutions that solve real-world problems and offer seamless user experiences.</p>
                        <p>Before entering the world of software, I served as a firefighter and EMT — a role that taught me the value of teamwork, clear communication, and staying calm under pressure. Working in high-stakes environments helped me develop critical thinking, adaptability, and the ability to remain focused no matter the challenge. These qualities now shape how I approach software development and problem-solving every day.</p>
                        <p>While working full-time as a first responder, I pursued and earned my Bachelor of Science in Software Engineering. Balancing long shifts and emergency calls with rigorous coursework wasn't easy — but it reflects my commitment to growth, discipline, and my passion for building meaningful technology.</p>
                        <p>When I'm not coding, you can find me hiking or brushing up on my photography skills. These activities help me recharge and stay creative, which I bring back to my development work.</p>
                        <p>I believe that great software is built on clean code, thoughtful architecture, and user-centered design. My goal is to combine technical excellence with real-world perspective to create solutions that are not only functional, but impactful.</p>
